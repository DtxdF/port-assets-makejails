Cert Warden (formerly LeGo CertHub) is a centralized certificate
management and ACME client.

Generally you set up the certificates you want on Cert Warden once
and Cert Warden will automatically renew them on a regular basis.
Clients that use the certificates fetch them from Cert Warden using
a GET api call with an API key. This eliminates the intricacies of
RFC 8555 for all of the certificate clients and replaces it with
one standard secured GET call.
